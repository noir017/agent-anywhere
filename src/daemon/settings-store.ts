/**
 * The write half of `/setting`: validate a chosen value, patch config.yaml, and apply it to the
 * daemon that is already running.
 *
 * `core/settings.ts` owns WHAT is editable and what a value means; this owns the file and the live
 * Config object. The split is the same one the model menu draws — the pure module decides, the
 * daemon-side module touches the world.
 *
 * ── The order is fixed, and each step is load-bearing ─────────────────────────
 * 1. parse the value (core), 2. skip a no-op write, 3. **validate a whole candidate config**,
 * 4. resolve the on-disk path, 5. patch the file, 6. apply in memory.
 *
 * Step 3 is the one that earns its keep. `/setting` writes to the file the daemon needs in order to
 * start, from a chat message, possibly from a phone: a value that parses but fails
 * `ConfigSchema.superRefine` (say `routing.default` naming an agent that is not in `agents`) would
 * leave a deployment that runs until it is restarted and then refuses to. Validating a candidate
 * copy first turns that into a refusal in chat.
 *
 * ── Secrets ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The candidate copy holds `${VAR}`-expanded values, and it never reaches disk: only the single
 * scalar the user chose is patched, through the Document API, which leaves every other line of the
 * file — templates included — byte-identical. See AGENTS.md security invariant #4.
