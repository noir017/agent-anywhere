# `src/config/` — configuration

Owns the config file: its schema, loading, validation, `${VAR}` expansion, and the
v0→v1 migration. This is the bottom of the [dependency stack](../../AGENTS.md#layering) —
it imports only `platform/config-schemas.ts` (the per-platform credential schemas) and
nothing else from the project.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `schema.ts` | The zod schema, the frozen `EXPERIENCE` block, `Config` type, and accessor helpers |
| `load.ts` | Path resolution (`configDir`/`configPath`/`defaultSocketPath`), `loadConfig`, `saveConfig` |
| `env-expand.ts` | `${VAR}` expansion over the parsed tree + the `.env` sidecar loader |
| `migrate.ts` | v0 (`platform:` object) → v1 (`platforms:` map). Disposable by design. |

## The central design decision: a small user surface

The config file has exactly five sections — `platforms`, `agents`, `routing`,
`session`, `access` — plus an optional `display`. Everything else that *looks* like
config (stream throttling, tool-bubble rendering, inbound merge windows, attachment
limits, reaction emoji, the IPC socket) is **not** user-configurable. It lives in the
frozen `EXPERIENCE` constant in `schema.ts` and is merged into every loaded `Config` at
load time.

```
UserConfig  (what config.yaml can contain, validated by ConfigSchema)
   + EXPERIENCE  (frozen constants, not in the file)
   = Config      (what the runtime reads: cfg.stream.*, cfg.tools.*, cfg.inbound.*, …)
```

The runtime still reads `cfg.stream.charThreshold` as if it were configured — only the
*file surface* dropped it. Changing one of those values is a **code change on purpose**.
They were removed because nobody tuned them and exposing them only bloated the file.

**So before adding a config field, ask which side of that line it falls on.** A
per-deployment decision (a credential, which agent answers where, who is allowed) goes
in `ConfigSchema`. A tuning knob for the streaming experience goes in `EXPERIENCE`.

Two fields were deliberately promoted from `EXPERIENCE` to the user surface when they
turned out to be per-deployment decisions after all: `freeResponseChannels` and
`ignoredChannels` (now under `platforms.<id>.chat`) were dead config while frozen. The
gating rules split accordingly — see [`core/inbound-gate.ts`](../core/README.md).

`session.idleTimeoutMs` was born on the user side for the same reason. It bounds how long
an idle conversation keeps its resident agent process, and the right answer is a property
of the machine, not of this project: `scope: per_thread` means every topic anyone has
messaged holds its own harness child (a Claude Code process is hundreds of MB), so a NAS
and a workstation genuinely want different numbers. The turn-level guardrail next to it
(`session.turnTimeoutMs`, the per-turn silence watchdog) stays frozen — nobody tunes that
per deployment. See [`daemon/README.md`](../daemon/README.md#conversation-lifetime) for
what reclaim does and the four conditions it requires.

`display.reactions.enabled` cannot live next to the emoji it controls: anything nested
under a key `EXPERIENCE` owns gets overwritten by `withExperienceDefaults`. That is why
the toggle is under `display` and the emoji stay in `inbound.reactions`.

## Load pipeline

Order matters and is fixed:

```
read file → YAML parse → v0 migration (in memory, warns)
          → ${VAR} expansion  ← happens ONCE, here
          → ConfigSchema.parse (zod, + superRefine cross-checks)
          → withExperienceDefaults
          → Config
```

Expansion sits after parse and before validation for a reason: `setup` and
`saveConfig` operate on the **raw, unexpanded** object, so an expanded secret is never
written back to disk. Do not move it.

`${VAR}` resolves from `process.env` plus a `<configDir>/.env` sidecar (loaded without
overriding existing env vars). `$${VAR}` escapes to a literal `${VAR}`. All missing
variables are collected and thrown as **one** error listing every config path — the
user fixes everything in one pass. Keep that aggregate style; it matches the zod error
report.

### Path resolution precedence

`configDir()` / `configPath()` resolve, highest first:

1. `AGENT_ANYWHERE_CONFIG_FILE` — an explicit file; its parent is the dir.
2. `AGENT_ANYWHERE_CONFIG_DIR` — a directory containing `config.yaml`.
3. `~/.config/agent-anywhere/`.

The `--config <path>` flag works by *setting* `AGENT_ANYWHERE_CONFIG_FILE` on
`process.env` (see `cli.ts`), so the agent subprocess inherits it and its reverse
commands resolve the same config and socket. That is why the env var exists rather than
threading a parameter.

The config dir also holds `daemon.sock`, `conversations.json`, `attachments/`, and `bin/`
(the reverse-CLI shim).

## Validation is fail-fast

`ConfigSchema.superRefine` enforces referential integrity at load, not at use:

- `routing.default` and every `pipeline[].use.agent` must name a real agent id.
- `pipeline[].when.platform` must name a real platform **instance** id (the `platforms`
  map key), not a platform type.
- Cross-field platform rules that a `discriminatedUnion` member cannot express:
  `slack` with `protocol: http` requires `signing`; `lark` with `protocol: http`
  requires `selfUrl`.

Without these, a typo surfaces much later as an obscure runtime error in whichever code
path first touches that id. Add new cross-field rules here, in `superRefine` — zod's
`discriminatedUnion` requires plain `ZodObject` members, so they cannot go in
`platform/config-schemas.ts`.

## Helpers other modules use

- `parseConfig(raw)` — validate + merge experience defaults. Used by tests.
- `platformInstances(cfg)` — the `platforms` map as `(id + entry)` objects, which is
  what the adapter factory consumes.
- `findAgent(cfg, id)` — agent lookup.
- `agentDisplayName(def, fallbackId)` — the **harness** name (`claude`, `opencode`),
  not the config id. The id is an operator's typing shorthand (`cc`, `oc`) and means
  nothing to someone reading the chat. `custom` falls back to the id, since its harness
  name says nothing either.
- `accessUnrestricted(cfg)` — the security signal. True when `allowFrom` is empty.
  `loadConfig` and `doctor` both warn on it. See
  [security invariants](../../AGENTS.md#security-invariants).

## Migration (`migrate.ts`)

v0 files had a single `platform:` object with Discord fields on the top level and other
platforms' credentials in an untyped `options` pocket. v1 is the typed `platforms:` map.

`loadConfig` migrates **in memory** with a one-line warning, so old files keep working.
`agent-anywhere doctor --migrate-config` rewrites the file (backing up to
`config.yaml.bak` first).

This module is deliberately self-contained and **disposable**: delete it one major
version after v1 lands. Migration layers that never die grow into a swamp. Do not let
other code start depending on it.

## Tests

`display.test.ts`, `env-expand.test.ts`, `load.test.ts`, `migrate.test.ts`,
`save-load.test.ts`, `security.test.ts`.

`security.test.ts` pins `accessUnrestricted`, which gates the loudest warning in the
product. `save-load.test.ts` pins the round-trip that must not leak expanded secrets.

> Two tests in `load.test.ts` fail on Windows: they assert POSIX path separators.
> Pre-existing, platform-specific.
