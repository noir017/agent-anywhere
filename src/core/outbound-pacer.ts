/**
 * One outbound write budget per chat.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every writer in the system had its own idea of how fast it could write, and the platform has
 * only one. `StreamBuffer` throttled itself to ~1 edit/1200 ms; `ToolRenderer` had no throttle at
 * all and repainted its bubble on every tool start AND every tool finish; the reactions, the acks,
 * the menus and the agent's own reverse commands were unthrottled by construction. Telegram counts
 * all of that as one stream per chat, so it answered 429 — 78 times in a single daemon run, with
 * `retry after` climbing to 229 seconds, each one a progress update that never arrived.
 *
 * A per-writer throttle cannot fix that no matter how it is tuned: the quantity being limited is a
 * SUM, and no summand can see it. So the budget lives here, once, and every write passes through.
 *
 * ── The model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   submit(job) ─▶ [ per-chat FIFO ] ─▶ token bucket (chat) ─▶ token bucket (instance) ─▶ run()
 *                        │
 *                        └─ a queued EDIT is replaced in place by a newer edit to the same message
 *
 * - **FIFO per chat.** Submission order is delivery order, so a tool bubble submitted before the
 *   text below it stays above that text no matter how congested the lane is.
 * - **Token bucket, not a fixed interval.** An idle chat writes immediately (burst tokens are
 *   waiting); a busy one paces. A fixed interval gets this backwards — it delays the first write
 *   of a quiet turn and still over-sends during a flood.
 * - **Coalescing.** An edit is a statement about a message's final content, so when two are queued
 *   for the same message only the newest is worth sending; the older resolves as `superseded`. A
 *   send creates a new object whose ref the caller needs back, so a send is never coalesced. The
 *   replacement keeps the queue POSITION its first version earned, which is what preserves order.
 * - **Pausing.** `penalize(key, ms)` stops a lane for exactly as long as the platform asked. This
 *   is chat-scoped and temporary — the opposite of the message-scoped, permanent seal in
 *   `stream-buffer.ts` (see "Sealing vs. pacing" in the module README).
 *
 * ── What may be dropped ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Waiting is only correct for a write that is still worth making when the wait ends:
 *
 * | class      | meaning                        | dropped when                                    |
 * |------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
 * | `reply`    | the answer, and anything the agent explicitly asked for | never          |
 * | `progress` | tool bubbles: a running commentary | superseded, or queued past `progressMaxWaitMs` |
 * | `typing`   | an indicator that expires by itself | immediately, unless a token is free right now |
 *
 * Dropping is reported as `WriteDroppedError`, never as success: the caller's state is untouched
 * and it is free to write the same content again. That is what makes "a progress update is never
 * lost" structural rather than lucky — the bubble's state simply stays undelivered until a later
 * paint carries it.
 *
 * Pure: no clock, no IO. `now()`/`schedule()` are injected, the same seam `StreamSink` uses.
