# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`harness: agy` preset**: Google's Antigravity CLI (the Gemini CLI successor). Unlike every
  other preset, `agy` has no ACP mode at all, so it is driven over its own documented headless
  `stream-json` protocol by a sibling runtime (`daemon/agent-agy.ts`) implementing the same
  `AgentFactory` contract — streaming, tool bubbles, multi-turn context, post-restart resume
  (via `--conversation`) and interrupt all behave as they do for the ACP harnesses. Requires the
  `agy` CLI on PATH; auth reuses its own Google sign-in from the OS keyring.

  Its own slash commands are disabled by default (`--disable-slash-commands`): in stream-json
  mode a CLI-answered slash such as `/model` aborts the entire session, which chat users would
  trip constantly. Pass `args: ["--disable-slash-commands=false"]` to opt back in. All default
  flags are overridable through `args`. Consequently agy gets no `/agy` picker entry and the
  generic vocabulary reports "unsupported" for it, rather than forwarding a name that would
  kill the session.

  Note: Google's FAQ states that third-party access to Antigravity violates its Terms of
  Service. This harness calls only agy's official headless interface and never handles
  credentials, but the daemon is still a non-Google client driving the account.

- **Text command routing**: `routing.pipeline` rules with `when.command` now match the leading
  `/name` of plain message text, so command routing works on every platform — no native
  slash-command support needed (previously `when.command` could never match: the command field
  was never populated on the message path). A rule that matches via `command` consumes the
  prefix — the routed agent receives only the rest of the message — and a bare `/name` is
  acked with a usage hint instead of starting an empty turn. Commands matching no rule still
  pass through to the agent untouched (`/model` etc. keep working).

- **`harness: opencode` preset**: OpenCode via its native ACP mode (`opencode acp`, per the
  ACP registry's official launch spec). Requires the opencode CLI on PATH; auth reuses its
  own login state.

- **DingTalk (钉钉) platform** (`type: dingtalk`, via `@satorijs/adapter-dingtalk`): org-internal
  robot with Stream mode by default (outbound WebSocket — no public callback URL), or
  `protocol: http` for a classic webhook. Outbound messages are `sampleMarkdown`, with agent
  CommonMark pre-rendered to DingTalk's markdown subset (tables→bullets, block regrouping for
  the "single `\n` is not a line break" quirk) and sent past the adapter's escaping encoder.
  DMs and group chats both work (group messages reach a robot only when @-mentioned, which the
  mention gate honors). No edit/reaction/typing/buttons — streaming degrades to chunked sends,
  and `ask` is unavailable on this platform.

### Fixed
- **noEdit platforms never delivered any reply** (DingTalk/QQ/LINE/WeCom — every platform without
  in-place message editing): the StreamBuffer's degraded path recorded mid-stream accumulations as
  "already delivered" without sending them, so the end-of-turn whole-send was skipped as
  "unchanged" and the agent's reply silently vanished. Masked in tests by the old non-empty
  streaming cursor (production streams with `cursor: ''`, making the mid-stream and final renders
  identical). The agent replied every time — the buffer just never flushed it.

- **`harness: codex` actually works now**: it spawned `codex acp`, but the codex CLI has no such
  subcommand — "acp" fell into the TUI, which dies headless with "stdin is not a terminal", so
  every turn failed with "ACP connection closed". The harness now spawns Zed's
  [codex-acp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zed-industries/codex-acp) adapter (a declared
  dependency, platform binary resolved directly); auth reuses the codex CLI's own login state.

### Changed
- **Session keys are agent-qualified** (`<agentId>:<platform>:c:<channelId>` …): two agents
  addressed in the same channel/user/thread scope keep separate conversations instead of the
  first-created agent capturing the session forever. One-time effect on upgrade: previously
  persisted sessions (`sessions.json`) no longer match and those conversations start fresh.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Config reference for agents** (`skill/references/config.md`): a complete, schema-accurate
  reference for `config.yaml` (per-platform credentials, routing, session scopes, `access.allowFrom`,
  and what is deliberately not configurable), so an agent can safely edit the gateway config when
  asked from inside the chat.
- **README "Agent skill" section** with a one-line install via
  [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):
  `npx skills add https://github.com/l0ng-ai/agent-anywhere/tree/main/skill -g`.

### Changed
- **Bundled skill rewritten** against the actual implementation: per-command output contracts
  (`messageId` returns, TOON examples, `count: 0` empty state), platform capability fallbacks
  (`reply` degrades to a plain send; `edit-message`/`create-thread`/`ask` fail with
  `unsupported operation`), error handling (`error:`/`help:` on stdout), and a new
  gateway-diagnostics section (`doctor`, config editing, why the agent must never restart
  the daemon it runs inside).
- README reordered install-first: Features → Quick start → Agent skill → Platforms → Configuration.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed (design)
- **Removed the per-agent `permission` policy.** The daemon is a headless ACP client and now
  auto-approves every tool call — agents always run with full tool access. Restricting tools, if
  wanted, is delegated to the harness (via `agents[].args`/`env`). The daemon's only access control
  is `access.allowFrom` (who may trigger an agent at all).

### Security
- **Access-control warning.** Because agents always have full tool access, an empty `access.allowFrom`
  means anyone who can message the bot can drive them. `agent-anywhere start` and `agent-anywhere doctor` now warn
  loudly on an empty allowlist (non-blocking); the setup wizard prompts for it.
- **SSRF: redirects are re-validated.** Attachment downloads follow redirects manually and re-run the
  private-address guard on every hop (previously a 3xx could bounce past the initial check).
- Proxy URLs are credential-redacted before logging; session tokens are compared in constant time.

### Changed (agent CLI / AXI)
- **Command surface tightened.** Removed `send-image` (it was a strict subset of `send-file` — both
  encode via `h.file`, so the image never inlined) and `typing` (the daemon already maintains a typing
  keep-alive for the whole turn, so a manual command was dead weight). Added `edit-message <id> <text>`
  so an agent can update a message it sent earlier (e.g. a progress line) in place.
- **`agent-anywhere` with no args now runs `doctor`** (read-only self-check), not `start` — a bare invocation
  shows live state instead of accidentally launching a daemon (AXI §8). `start` is now an explicit
  subcommand; `doctor` prints a `bin:`/`description` header (AXI §10). Start the daemon with `agent-anywhere start`.
- **`fetch-messages --fields attachments`** now emits a separate `attachments[]{messageId,type,url,name}`
  table so an agent can download referenced images/files by URL; a hint flags messages that have
  attachments when the column wasn't requested.
- **Reverse commands now speak [TOON](https://toonformat.dev/) on stdout** (via `@toon-format/toon`),
  not raw JSON — ~40% fewer tokens for the agent that reads them. Conversion happens only at the CLI
  output boundary (`commands/reverse.ts`); the daemon keeps speaking plain JSON over IPC.
- **`fetch-messages` output is now AXI-shaped**: a minimal default schema (`messageId,userId,content`),
  opt-in extra columns via `--fields` (validated; `attachments` renders as a count), per-row content
  truncation to 500 chars (with a count of how many were clipped), a `count` aggregate, paging/widening
  `help` hints, and a definitive empty state (`count: 0` + note) instead of an ambiguous `[]`.
- **Errors go to stdout, structured.** Reverse-command failures, unreachable-daemon hints, usage errors,
  and the top-level catch now emit a TOON `error:`/`help:` on stdout (commander's stderr is redirected),
  so the invoking agent can actually read and act on them. `create-thread`/`send-message`/`reply` etc.
  return actionable fields (`threadId` + a `--channel` hint; `messageId` for follow-ups).

### Added
- **Hung-agent watchdog** (`session.turnTimeoutMs`, default 10 min): aborts a turn after prolonged
  agent silence and reaps the subprocess, so a stuck agent can't pin a session forever.
- In-channel error notices: a failed turn now posts a readable reason, not just a ❌ reaction.
- Bot offline/disconnect/reconnect logging in the Satori adapter.
- Test coverage tooling (`npm run test:coverage` with thresholds), ESLint flat config (`npm run lint`),
  and a GitHub Actions CI workflow (typecheck + lint + test + coverage).
- Table-driven tests for the security-critical pure functions (SSRF guard, filename sanitizer,
  permission gate, IPC request parser, token registry) and the config security gate.
- `LICENSE` (MIT) and this changelog.

### Changed
- Removed dead type imports across platform profiles; tightened a few `let`→`const`.
