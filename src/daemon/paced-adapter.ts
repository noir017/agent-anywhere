/**
 * Put every outbound call through one shared per-chat budget (see `core/outbound-pacer.ts`).
 *
 * Applied once, to the daemon's `platforms` map, rather than at the ~38 call sites that write to a
 * chat. That is the whole point: the reply, the tool bubbles, the reactions, the acks, the menus
 * and the agent's own reverse commands are all counted by the platform as ONE stream per chat, so
 * they have to be metered in one place or not at all. Wrapping the map also means a path added
 * later is paced by default instead of by remembering.
 *
 * This is also the one place a platform's "wait N seconds" becomes a lane pause: the profile types
 * the failure (`classifyError` → `RateLimitedError`), this reads the number off it, and the pacer
 * holds every other writer to the same chat for the same time. Without that step each writer backs
 * off alone and the other three keep the flood alive.
 */

/**
 * How one adapter member interacts with the chat budget.
 *
 * - `write` — creates something in the chat. Paced; never coalesced (each call is its own object,
 *   and the caller needs the ref back).
 * - `edit`  — restates an existing message. Paced AND coalesced: two queued edits to one message
 *   collapse to the newer, because only the newest content was ever going to be shown.
 * - `unpaced` — reads, measurement, event registration, lifecycle. Not what floods a chat, and
 *   queueing a blocking read behind a 229 s pause buys nothing.
 *
 * `satisfies Record<keyof PlatformAdapter, …>` makes this exhaustive: a member added to
 * PlatformAdapter fails to compile here until someone decides which of the three it is.
