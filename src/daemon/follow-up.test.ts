/**
 * Out-of-turn output: what the gateway does when a harness keeps talking after its turn ended.
 *
 * The bug these pin: Claude Code puts long work in the background, ends its turn ("I've started
 * it, I'll report back"), and the Agent SDK re-invokes it on its own when the work finishes.
 * claude-agent-acp forwards that continuation as ordinary `session/update` notifications with no
 * prompt in flight — and the gateway used to have no reader and no address for them, so the
 * conversation went permanently silent at the exact moment the answer arrived.
 *
 * So the interesting assertions are about the two things that were missing: a message gets rendered
 * AT ALL once the turn is over, and it gets rendered only when there is something to show.
