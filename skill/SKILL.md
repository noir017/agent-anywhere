# agent-anywhere

The `agent-anywhere` command on your PATH acts on the conversation you are answering in. It is
already authenticated for it, and every command targets it unless `--channel` names another.

If you have `send_file` and `schedule` tools, they are the `send-file` and `schedule` commands
below — use the tools.

## Commands, by topic

Before using a topic, run `agent-anywhere help <topic>`: it prints that topic's commands, their
options and the rules that go with them, generated from the command itself, so it is always
current. `agent-anywhere help` lists the topics.

| topic | for |
|---|---|
| `files` | sending a file or image to the user |
| `schedule` | a prompt or a bash command that runs later or repeatedly, and survives restarts |
| `channels` | posting to another chat or topic, on any platform |
| `history` | reading earlier messages the user refers to ("the file I sent above") |
| `messages` | an extra message, a quote-reply, editing, reacting, deleting |
| `threads` | opening a thread from a message |
| `ask` | a question with buttons that blocks until answered — only without a question tool of your own |
| `voice` | what a voice message actually said, when one reads like a mishearing |

## Output and errors

Every command prints TOON on stdout, failures included (with exit code 1).

- `unsupported operation: …` — this platform cannot do that (editing, threads and buttons vary).
  Don't retry; fall back to the nearest thing that works, such as a new message instead of an edit.
- `AGENT_ANYWHERE_TURN_TOKEN is not set` — this shell is not inside an agent-anywhere session, so
  these commands are unavailable here.
- `cannot reach the daemon` — agent-anywhere is not running; tell the user.

## Diagnosing and configuring agent-anywhere

When the user reports agent-anywhere itself misbehaving ("Slack stopped responding", "add my
Telegram bot", "why can't you edit messages here?"):

```bash
agent-anywhere doctor
```

`doctor` is a read-only self-check — config validity, platform credentials, daemon socket, and
whether each agent harness is installed and signed in. Run it first and report what it finds.

- **Config file**: `$AGENT_ANYWHERE_CONFIG_FILE` if set (you inherit the daemon's environment, so
  this is the file it loaded), else `~/.config/agent-anywhere/config.yaml`. **Before writing any
  config, read [references/config.md](references/config.md)**: it is the complete field reference,
  and the loader rejects keys that are not in it. Validate with `agent-anywhere doctor` afterwards.
- **Changes take effect on a daemon restart — never restart it yourself.** You are running as a
  child of that daemon, so stopping it ends your own session mid-answer. Make the edit, then tell
  the user to restart it.
- **`agent-anywhere setup`** is an interactive wizard for a person at a terminal. Don't run it — it
  waits for keyboard input you cannot give. Edit the config file instead.
