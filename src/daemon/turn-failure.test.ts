/**
 * What a FAILED turn leaves in the chat.
 *
 * ── The bug this pins ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reply text is sent when its segment completes — at the next tool boundary, or when the turn is
 * finalized — so the last segment of every turn, usually its conclusion, exists only in the
 * buffer until the end. The failure path posted `❌ This turn failed` and skipped the finalize, so
 * that segment was thrown away. Reported 2026-09-29: claude-agent-acp never closed a turn whose
 * answer had fully arrived, the watchdog failed it ten minutes later, and the answer was never
 * sent — the chat showed the model's opening line, its tool bubbles, and then only the ❌.
 *
 * The streaming setting is left at its default (off) on purpose: that is the delivery mode in
 * which the unsent segment is the whole of the conclusion, rather than a few unflushed characters.
