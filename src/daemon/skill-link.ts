/**
 * Puts the bundled skill (`skill/` at the package root) where each harness looks for skills, as a
 * symlink named `agent-anywhere`.
 *
 * ── Why the daemon does this ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The skill is how an agent learns what the gateway can do beyond its two native tools — posting to
 * other chats, history, threads, buttons — at the cost of one line of skill description, delivered
 * by the harness's own skill mechanism rather than by text the gateway writes into the conversation.
 * Shipping it inside the package and linking it from here means:
 *  - it appears only on machines that run this daemon (a shared skill repo would put it in front of
 *    agents on every machine that syncs the repo, where the `agent-anywhere` command does not exist);
 *  - its content is always the running daemon's own — the link points into the installed package,
 *    so an upgrade updates the skill with nothing to re-copy.
 *
 * ── Where, per harness ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Probed, not assumed:
 *  - claude   — `<home>/.claude/skills` (its documented user-level location; skills-scan.ts).
 *  - codex    — `<home>/.agents/skills` (marker-skill experiment on codex-acp 1.12.0, skills-scan.ts).
 *  - agy      — `<home>/.gemini/config/skills`. Probed 2026-10-09 on agy 1.3.2 by asking the model
 *               to list its skills: a symlinked skill there was listed; the same link under
 *               `<home>/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills` — the global directory agy's own help names —
 *               was not, and neither was anything in `<home>/.agents/skills` from a working
 *               directory outside home (skills-scan.ts reads that one only because a workspace that
 *               IS home would). Linking to the cross-vendor directory alone left agy without the
 *               skill: asked to send a picture, it wrote a markdown image of a local path instead.
 *  - opencode — `<home>/.agents/skills`. Probed 2026-10-09 on opencode 2.0.26 by planting marker
 *               skills under an isolated HOME and asking the model to list its skills: it named the
 *               ones in `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills` and `~/.config/opencode/skills`, plus
 *               the project-level `.claude/`, `.agents/` and `.opencode/` ones. (Its `GET /api/skill`
 *               answered an empty list even with skills configured — not a usable probe.)
 *  - gemini, dsh, custom — none known; nothing is linked rather than a guess.
 * `.agents/skills` is the cross-vendor location, so one link serves codex and opencode.
 *
 * Only for a harness that has been run here: the link is made when the harness's own config
 * directory exists, never by creating one — the same rule agy-statusline.ts follows, for the same
 * reason (that would be this daemon inventing configuration for a product the operator may not use).
 * Called at every agent spawn, so a harness first logged in after the daemon started is picked up by
 * its next session rather than the next restart.
 *
 * ── What it will and will not touch ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A symlink by that name is taken to be ours and is repointed when it points elsewhere — an older
 * install, or a test daemon run from a checkout. A real directory or file by that name is the
 * operator's, and is left alone with a warning: they may be maintaining their own copy on purpose.
 * Like the reverse-CLI shim it writes to a SHARED path, so it carries the same guard: nothing happens
 * unless this process really is the CLI (a vitest worker is not), and AGENT_ANYWHERE_NO_SKILL_LINK=1
 * turns it off for a test daemon that must not repoint the live one's link.
