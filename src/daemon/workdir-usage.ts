/**
 * How often each directory has been chosen with `/cd` (`<configDir>/workdir-usage.json`).
 *
 * ── Why a file of its own ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is the one piece of state here that is NOT per conversation. "quantlab is where I spend my
 * days" is a fact about the machine, and a brand-new topic should benefit from it on its very first
 * menu — which is exactly what folding it into conversations.json would prevent. That file is also
 * literally a map of conversation key → record, validated entry by entry, so a usage table living
 * at its top level would be read back as one more malformed conversation and dropped on load.
 *
 * ── What is stored ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two numbers per absolute path, `{score, last}` — a complete stand-in for an unbounded visit
 * history, for the reason core/frecency.ts derives. Nothing else: no titles, no contents, no record
 * of WHICH conversation went where (that is in conversations.json and is nobody else's business).
 *
 * Directories are never pruned when they disappear from disk. A stale entry costs one JSON key and
 * ranks nothing (the menu only ever ranks paths the scan just found), while pruning would quietly
 * forget a project that happens to live on an unmounted volume the day the daemon restarted.
 *
 * Write-through on every change; a missing or corrupt file degrades to empty, because the worst
 * case of losing this is a menu in alphabetical order — the ordering it had before any of this
 * existed. It is never worth a crash, and never worth blocking a `/cd` on.
