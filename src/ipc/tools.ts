/**
 * The reverse commands an agent gets as native tools — served over MCP by `agent-anywhere mcp`
 * (commands/mcp.ts), which the daemon hands to every ACP session in `session/new`.
 *
 * ── Why two, and why these two ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A tool's definition is context the agent pays for whether or not it is used. Measured 2026-10-09:
 * on Claude Code (claude-agent-acp 0.81, which loads MCP tools in full at this size) these two cost
 * about 1,030 input tokens per request — cached after the first, but every request. Codex 0.159.2
 * lazy-loads MCP tools behind its own `tool_search`, and OpenCode 2.0.26 exposes them inside its
 * code tool (`tools.chat.send_file(…)`), so there they cost less and are found less directly. So a
 * tool has to earn its place by being something the agent could neither do without nor guess exists:
 *  - `send_file` — the one thing a text reply cannot carry. A file has to be uploaded.
 *  - `schedule` — the one capability an agent reliably gets wrong without being told: asked for
 *    "every morning at 8", it reaches for its own harness's scheduler, which lives inside the agent
 *    process and dies with it (the gateway stops idle sessions after an hour, and on every restart).
 * Everything else stays a CLI command behind the bundled skill, which costs one line of skill
 * description until it is needed (see HELP_TOPICS). The skill covers these two as well, which is
 * what an agent that does not see the tools up front — codex, agy — ends up using.
 *
 * ── One source ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A tool is a view of its REVERSE_COMMANDS entry, not a second definition of it: the parameters are
 * the command's positionals and options, their descriptions are the option descriptions, and the
 * arguments go through the spec's own `build` — so a tool call is validated exactly as the same
 * command typed into a shell would be, and a new option reaches the tool without anyone remembering
 * to add it. What a tool adds is only what a shell user does not need spelled out: a description
 * written for a model, and the closed sets a few values are checked against anyway.
 *
 * Every parameter is a string. Values are passed to the option's `parse` exactly as commander would
 * pass them (a number the model sends is stringified first), which keeps one parser per option; none
 * of the options exposed here is repeatable, and a repeatable one would need more than this.
