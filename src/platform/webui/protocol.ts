 * config binds to `0.0.0.0` by default, and behind it sits an agent with full tool access.
 *
 * So every inbound body is validated by a `.strict()` zod schema and never cast. `.strict()`
 * matters as much as the field types: it rejects unknown keys outright, which keeps the
 * shape the server reasons about equal to the shape it declared, forever.
 *
 * The OUTBOUND direction has types but no schemas, and that asymmetry is deliberate: those
 * objects are constructed by this process, so validating them would only assert that the
 * code did what it says. There is nothing to distrust in that direction.
