/**
 * claude-agent-acp's typed failure records (its "AIR session failure" extension): the capability
 * that asks for them, and how one is read off the wire.
 *
 * ── Why the gateway asks for them ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Without them, Claude Code retrying a failing API looks exactly like a hang. Reported 2026-10-06:
 * the newapi gateway first left a request hanging until it timed out after five minutes, then
 * answered `500 Database error` and a run of `503`s. Claude Code kept retrying for the whole ten
 * minutes (its transcript records each attempt as an `api_error`, out of 10), and the turn failed
 * with "sent no update for 600000ms … treating it as hung". The adapter DOES turn every attempt
 * into a "Retrying Claude, attempt N of M." record, but only for a client that advertised this
 * capability at `initialize`. Anyone else gets nothing, because the record is dropped inside the
 * adapter. Every update re-arms the silence watchdog, so receiving these records is the whole fix
 * for the false "hung". Showing them is what tells the user why the turn is slow.
 *
 * ── What else changes once a client asks ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Read from the 0.81.0 and 0.81.2 dist (identical for this extension) on 2026-10-06:
 * 1. A turn that fails on the provider, ends with no result, or loses its transport no longer
 *    REJECTS `session/prompt`. It resolves with `stopReason: "end_turn"` and puts the failure in
 *    `_meta`, so a client that asks and then does not look reports a failed turn as a success. The
 *    adapter also stops forwarding the error text as an ordinary agent message. runTurn reads the
 *    record and fails the turn with its title, which is the same text the rejection used to carry
 *    after its "Internal error: " prefix.
 * 2. A failure with no turn to attach to (a background cycle's own, a sign-out, a dying worker)
 *    arrives as a `session_info_update`. So does the model-fallback advisory, which used to be a
 *    bold line inside the agent's text. Both become notices (see the `onSessionFailure` wiring in
 *    agent-acp.ts).
 * 3. The one rejection left, a stream that died outside a turn, loses its raw detail: the adapter
 *    strips it in favour of the record. The adapter still writes it to stderr, which is daemon.log.
 * 4. `session/load` re-publishes past usage-limit failures from history. That is history, not
 *    news, and it arrives before the first prompt, which is where the runtime stops announcing.
 *
 * ⚠️ HYRUM'S LAW: `_meta.jetbrains.air` is claude-agent-acp's private extension (named for
 * JetBrains' AIR client), not ACP. session-failure.test.ts runs this module against the installed
 * adapter's own encoder and capability check. If either is renamed the test fails, instead of the
 * false "hung" quietly coming back.
