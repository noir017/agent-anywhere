 *
 * ── Why the list is "what the daemon has seen" ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Most platforms cannot enumerate where a bot is. The Telegram Bot API has no call that lists a
 * bot's chats at all; a webhook-style bot on the others only learns of a channel when something is
 * said in it. So the honest source is the conversation store: every place a turn has run, with the
 * title the gateway gave it and when it was last used. That also makes the list the right one —
 * a place nobody has talked to the bot in is not a place anyone expects its output.
 *
 * Pure: the caller hands over the records, the configured instances and the clock-free options.

 * instance, and a key with any other number of `#` fields is skipped rather than guessed at — so a
 * channel id that itself contains `#` is left out, not mis-split. Each such record gets a real
