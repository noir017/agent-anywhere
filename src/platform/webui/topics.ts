/**
 * The web UI's topics: the list of parallel conversations the page can switch between.
 *
 * Modelled on a Telegram forum / a Feishu topic group — each topic is a lane on the one
 * channel, so each is its own conversation with its own agent session and its own
 * harness-generated name (see `room.ts` for the addressing, and `index.ts` for why the lane
 * rather than a separate channel).
 *
 * ── Why this is persisted, and why it is a file of its own ───────────────────
 * Losing this list is not "the page looks empty after a restart". The daemon's
 * `conversations.json` still holds the agent binding and the per-agent session id under
 * `<instance>#main#<topic id>`, so every one of those contexts would still be alive — just
 * unreachable, because nothing would know the ids any more.
 *
 * It duplicates one field the daemon already stores: `ConversationStore.conversationTitle`
 * keeps a title too. That duplication is forced by the layering rather than chosen —
 * `platform/` may not import `daemon/` — and the two answer different questions. The daemon's
 * is "what is this conversation called", and it does not exist until a turn has run; this one
 * is "which rooms does the page have", and a topic created a second ago with nothing said in
 * it has to be in it. Do not try to merge them.
 *
 * Shape and failure behaviour copied from `daemon/workdir-usage.ts`: write-through, a missing
 * or corrupt file degrades to empty, and it is never worth a crash.
