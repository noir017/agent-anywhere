/**
 * The live status of each conversation's agent, pushed to any platform that can show one
 * (`PlatformAdapter.setStatus` — the web UI's strip above its composer).
 *
 * ── What it costs, which is the design constraint ─────────────────────────────
 * Nothing is polled. Every value here arrives on an event the daemon was already handling — an
 * ACP `usage_update`, an agy status-line frame, a turn ending — and the board only decides whether
 * that is worth passing on:
 *
 *  - a status identical to the last one sent is not sent (agy repeats its frame on every render
 *    tick, and claude-agent-acp re-sends the model and effort after every turn);
 *  - a changed one goes out at most once per MIN_INTERVAL_MS per conversation, leading and
 *    trailing, so a turn emitting a `usage_update` per API call costs the page one update every
 *    two seconds at worst and the final state always lands;
 *  - a conversation whose lane is on a platform with no `setStatus` never gets past `target()`, so
 *    a Telegram topic does no work here at all — including the transcript read below.
 *
 * The one piece of IO is claude's cache expiry, which only its transcript knows (see
 * claude-transcript.ts). It is read once per finished model cycle, a moment after it finishes —
 * never per update. Between reads, a request seen live is projected forward with the TTL the last
 * read established, which is arithmetic.
 *
 * ── Why a board and not fields on ConversationState ───────────────────────────
 * The registry already keeps `lastUsage` for `/context`, and could have kept the rest beside it.
 * But a status is assembled from five sources at five moments and owes a throttle, a dedupe and a
 * timer per conversation; folding that into a 3000-line registry would bury the one rule that
 * matters — nothing is sent that was not just reported — under everything else it does.
