/**
 * A reverse proxy to the `ttyd` behind the terminal pane, over a unix socket.
 *
 * ── Why the terminal is not built here ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing in this daemon has raw terminal output to offer. Both agent runtimes spawn their
 * child over plain pipes and read strictly line-delimited JSON (`agent-acp.ts`,
 * `agent-agy.ts`); a line that does not parse is dropped, and the ACP handshake even declares
 * `terminal: false`. A pane showing "the command line" therefore cannot tap the agent — it has
 * to be a second, parallel thing: a real PTY, and a terminal emulator in the browser.
 *
 * Building that here would mean a native PTY binding (the first compiled dependency in the
 * tree — and node-pty publishes no Linux prebuilds, so every Linux install would need a
 * toolchain), plus xterm.js, plus a WebSocket server, plus scrollback, resize, reconnect and a
 * mobile key bar. `ttyd` is 1.3 MB of static binary that already does all of it, with CJK and
 * IME support this page would otherwise have to re-earn. So the daemon owns none of it and
 * proxies instead: the operator's image runs ttyd on a unix socket, and this file is the door.
 *
 * The consequence worth stating plainly: what the pane shows is whatever that ttyd was told to
 * run. That is the whole reason it works with any coding-agent CLI, and also why nothing in it
 * reaches the conversation — no transcript, no reverse CLI, no topic history.
 *
 * ── Why a unix socket ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not a port. Nothing on the network can reach a socket file, so the session check in
 * `server.ts` is the only way in rather than one of two — there is no second door left open by
 * a firewall rule nobody wrote.
 *
 * ── Two things that must not happen ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Responses are passed through byte for byte. ttyd compresses its own 730 KB single-file page
 * down to ~190 KB and says so in `Content-Encoding`; running that back through this server's
 * `body()` would gzip a gzip and hand the browser something it cannot read.
 *
 * And every upstream socket is destroyed when its downstream dies, in both directions. An
 * orphaned connection to ttyd would keep `server.close()` from ever calling back — the same
 * trap the event stream has, with the same symptom: Ctrl-C hangs forever rather than leaking
 * quietly. `server.test.ts` pins it.
