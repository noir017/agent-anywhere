/**
 * `/effort` as data: the menu, its button ids, matching a typed level, and every string it says.
 *
 * ── Why it is not the model menu with another header ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * It very nearly is — a frozen option snapshot, a ● on the current entry, the value re-checked at
 * click time — and the daemon side mirrors PendingModelMenu for exactly those reasons. What differs
 * is the list. A model list runs to 93 entries and needs paging; an effort list is the handful of
 * levels one model supports (six on claude, five or six on codex and opencode, probed 2026-09-23),
 * so it has no pages at all. Folding it into the model menu would buy a page counter that never
 * shows and a union type on every model-menu call site, to save one small file.
 *
 * The other difference is who owns the list. Effort levels belong to the MODEL, not the session:
 * opencode offers them only for a model with reasoning variants, codex only for a model in its own
 * catalog, and switching model reshapes the list or removes it. That is why "no levels" has its own
 * per-harness explanation below instead of a single sentence.

 *   newer codex-cli or a catalogued model, and the level meanwhile comes from config.toml.
 * - **opencode** offers levels only for a model with reasoning variants (none on
 *   `opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free`; switching to an Anthropic model adds them).
