/**
 * When a Claude Code session's prompt cache expires, read off the session's own transcript.
 *
 * ── Why the transcript ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is the only place the answer exists in this deployment. Claude Code's TUI hands its status
 * line a `prompt_cache.expires_at`, but the SDK under claude-agent-acp runs Claude Code headless,
 * and headless it never runs a status line at all: probed on 2.1.291 (2026-10-08) with
 * `-p --output-format stream-json` and a `statusLine` naming a recording script, a whole turn
 * produced zero invocations. ACP carries no TTL either — claude-agent-acp 0.81.0 sends
 * `{used, size, cost}` in `usage_update` and folds cache writes into one number in
 * `PromptResponse._meta.quota`, dropping the 5-minute/1-hour split.
 *
 * The transcript keeps that split. Every assistant entry carries the API's own usage block,
 *
 *   "usage": { "cache_read_input_tokens": 253742, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 718,
 *              "cache_creation": { "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 718, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0 } }
 *
 * and every entry a `timestamp`. That is everything "when does this expire" needs.
 *
 * Hyrum's Law applies, and harder than usual: this is Claude Code's private on-disk format, not an
 * interface. The file is `<config dir>/projects/<cwd with every non-alphanumeric as '-'>/<session
 * id>.jsonl`, and the ACP session id IS that file name (verified 2026-10-08 against all 27 cc
 * sessions in this machine's conversation store, resumed ones included). The day either changes,
 * `readCacheExpiry` finds nothing and the status bar loses its cache segment — it shows nothing
 * rather than something wrong, and claude-transcript.test.ts pins the shape with a captured entry.
 *
 * ── What "expires" means ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A cached prefix lives one TTL past its last use, and every request either reads it or writes it.
 * So the expiry is the time of the session's LAST REQUEST plus the TTL that prefix was written
 * with. Two details make that more than "last timestamp + 1h":
 *
 *  - The request time is not the assistant entry's timestamp, which is written when the response
 *    ARRIVES. A response that thought for 52 seconds (measured on this machine's own transcript)
 *    would push the expiry 52 seconds past the truth, which on a 5-minute TTL is a sixth of it.
 *    The request went out right after the entry before it — the user's prompt or the tool result
 *    being answered — so that entry's timestamp is used.
 *  - A request that only READ the cache wrote nothing, so its usage names no TTL. It still renewed
 *    the prefix it read, at whatever TTL that prefix was written with, so the TTL is taken from the
 *    most recent request that did write.
