/**
 * Voice messages, the running half: download, transcribe, show the transcript, wait for the tap,
 * hand the words on, and log every step. The decisions are core/voice.ts; read its header first.
 *
 * ── Where this sits in the inbound path ───────────────────────────────────────
 * ConversationRegistry.route() offers every message to `take()` past the access check, the gate,
 * the daemon commands and the agent binding — and before the merger. Each placement is load-bearing:
 * a message from someone not on the allowlist must not spend transcription quota; a `/stop` must
 * still be a `/stop`; and a voice note must NOT reach the merger, whose job is to interrupt the
 * running turn — a recording the user has not yet approved interrupting the agent would be exactly
 * the half-confirmed behavior the card exists to prevent. The interruption happens when the
 * transcript is sent, like any typed message.
 *
 * A confirmed transcript re-enters through `deliver` — route() again, as text — so it is answered
 * by everything a typed message is: it can answer a question the agent is waiting on, `/stop` in a
 * transcript is a `/stop`, and the 👀/✅ reactions land on the original voice note because the
 * message id is kept.
 *
 * ── Why transcriptions are serialized per conversation ────────────────────────
 * Two voice notes sent back to back are transcribed in parallel otherwise, and whichever finished
 * first would be sent first — with `confirm: false`, the agent would receive the second sentence
 * before the first. So each conversation's voice notes form one chain.
