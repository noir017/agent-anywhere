/**
 * What a harness wrote in its OWN log about a turn the gateway cannot see into.
 *
 * ── Why this file has to exist ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The silence watchdog can tell that a turn went quiet; it cannot tell why, and the difference
 * matters to the person waiting. Reported 2026-09-17: every `oc` turn sat at "typing" for ten
 * minutes and then failed with `agent "oc" sent no update for 600000ms; treating it as hung`. The
 * agent was not hung at all — opencode's free model pool was rate-limiting it, and opencode was
 * retrying in a loop.
 *
 * None of that reaches the gateway. Verified on opencode 1.18.30 (2026-09-17) while reproducing the
 * report: over ACP the prompt neither settles nor rejects, nothing is written to the child's stderr
 * (which agent-acp.ts already forwards to the daemon log — `grep -c "Rate limit" daemon.log` → 0),
 * and the only record anywhere on the machine is opencode's own log file:
 *
 *   timestamp=2026-09-17T12:23:38.570Z level=ERROR run=fc674adf message="stream error"
 *     providerID=opencode modelID=muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free
 *     session.id=ses_f50ad7853ffe6X1R7a1EXaR7CF small=false agent=build mode=primary
 *     error.error="AI_APICallError: Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
 *
 * That `session.id` is the same id the daemon holds as its ACP session, which is what makes this
 * worth doing: the errors of ONE conversation can be picked out of a log shared by all of them.
 *
 * ⚠️ HYRUM'S LAW: a log file is not an API. opencode documents neither this path nor this line
 * format, and is free to change both in any release. Everything here is therefore built to degrade
 * to silence — a moved file, a renamed field or an unparsable line yields no events, which puts the
 * timeout message back to exactly the text it had before this file existed. It never throws into a
 * turn, and it is never consulted on the happy path.
 *
 * ── Why per-harness rather than one parser ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Because the answer "where does this harness admit its failures" is different for each one, and
 * only opencode currently needs asking: claude-agent-acp rejects the prompt with its reason (the
 * `[ede_diagnostic]` failures in daemon.log arrived this way and were already actionable), and agy
 * speaks no ACP at all. The registry keeps that per-harness knowledge in one place so the next
 * harness that goes silent is a table entry, not a new seam.
