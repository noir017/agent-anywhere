/**
 * `/cd` as data: page math, labels, button ids, matching, and every string either surface says.
 *
 * ── Why this module exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An agent's working directory was a deployment decision (`agents[].cwd`) and nothing else, so a
 * phone user driving a machine with a dozen projects on it could reach exactly one of them. The
 * missing half is per-CONVERSATION: "this topic is about quantlab, that one about the gateway".
 *
 * Harness-agnostic on purpose. Every runtime this gateway drives takes a working directory at
 * startup — ACP passes it to `session/new`, agy takes it as the child's cwd and its `--add-dir`
 * trust root — so `/cd` means the same thing under `/cc`, `/oc` and `/agy`, and nothing in this
 * file knows which one is bound.
 *
 * Deliberately shaped as a sibling of core/model-menu.ts rather than a generalisation of it. The
 * two menus agree on everything the platform imposes (page size, label budget, id grammar — all
 * shared through paging.ts and button-id.ts) and on nothing else: a model list arrives from the
 * harness over ACP and switching one is a live in-session call, while a directory list is read off
 * the local filesystem and switching one necessarily starts a new session (see workdirChoiceText).
 * Folding them together would have to encode that difference as a flag at every branch.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: the scan lives in daemon/workdir-scan.ts (it needs fs), the posting and
 * clicking in daemon/, and the two surfaces — menu and text — are built from these same functions
 * so a tap and a typed `/cd quantlab` cannot describe the same outcome differently.
