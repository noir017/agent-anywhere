 *     by hand, so it outranks the built-in table (and lets a deployment point `/cc` at a second
 *     claude agent, or keep an alias the presets know nothing about);
 *  2. a built-in agent command (`/cc`, `/oc`, `/agy`) — the registered menu entries. Placed ABOVE
 *     a non-command pipeline rule because naming an agent is an explicit instruction, while a
 *     rule matching on platform/channel only supplies that conversation's default answerer;
 *     without this step every registered agent command was inert unless the operator had also
 *     written a matching pipeline rule, and reached the bound agent as the literal text "/oc";
 *  3. whatever rule matched on where the message came from — the initial binding;
