/**
 * The running half of scheduled tasks: when to look, what to do when something is due, and the
 * bookkeeping that keeps a restart from repeating or losing a run. The decisions are core/schedule.ts
 * (`decide`); how a run is actually carried out — a bash process, a turn in a conversation — is the
 * executor the daemon injects, so this file never touches a platform or an agent.
 *
 * ── One timer, re-armed ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * After every look the timer is set for the earliest thing due, capped at LOOK_AGAIN_MS. The cap is
 * not an optimisation: it is what makes a host clock that jumps (NTP after a suspend, a container
 * restored from a snapshot) cost at most a minute rather than a whole setTimeout's worth of drift,
 * and it keeps every timeout far below Node's 2^31 ms ceiling.
 *
 * ── The order of the bookkeeping is the point ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `lastPlannedAt` is written BEFORE a run starts. If the daemon dies mid-run, the run is not made
 * again on restart — an at-most-once promise, which for "post the morning brief" and "run this
 * backup" is the right one. The outcome is written when the run ends.
