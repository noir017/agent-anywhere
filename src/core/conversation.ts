 * A chat platform's "where" is not always a single id. Telegram forum topics and
 * Slack threads are a `(channel, sub-lane)` PAIR: the lane is a separate wire
 * parameter (`message_thread_id`, `thread_ts`), not part of the channel id. The
 * previous model had one opaque `channelId: string`, so a topic had to be smuggled
 * through as the composite string `"<chatId>:<topicId>"` — built in five places,
 * decoded in seventeen, validated in none. Every path that forgot to decode sent to
 * the wrong place, and because Telegram truncates a malformed chat_id LENIENTLY in
 * private chats, half those failures were silent.
 *
 * So the pair is a struct. The composite string is gone; it survives only at the two
 * boundaries that genuinely need text (the persisted store key and the `--channel`
 * CLI flag), each with one tested formatter and one validating parser below.
